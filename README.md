## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

### Links

- Solution URL: [https://hudarashid.github.io/Fylo-data-storage-component/]

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
1. Positioning the pink progress bar for different width
2. Positioning the background-img and setting background color.

```css
.bg {
  background: url('../images/bg-desktop.png')  $veryDarkBlue;
  background-position: bottom -1.25em left 0px;
}
```


### Continued development

Try to build the progress bar by using JS



### Useful resources

- [https://css-tricks.com/perfect-full-page-background-image/] - Perhaps the most revisited site to understand the setting of the background image.
